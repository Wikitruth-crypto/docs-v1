### Acknowledgements

Thanks to all truth providers, partners, investors, and community users who have contributed to WikiTruth. It is because of your support and trust that WikiTruth can continue to move forward and promote the development of social justice. At the same time, we still want to thank those who stood up for the truth. Maybe you haven't used WikiTruth, but you are all warriors fighting for the truth.

**Thanks to Web3**
The rise of Web3 is not only a reflection of technological progress but also a profound reflection and subversion of the traditional Internet model.
The crypto world belonging to Web3 is built on a globally available basis. With its almost frictionless characteristics,
it breaks the inherent limitations of Web2 and provides everyone with fair opportunities to participate and achieve themselves.

In this new network era, Web3 gives individuals greater autonomy and choice. Compared with the Web2 era which relied too much on centralized platforms,
Web3 no longer requires us to place our trust in a single entity, but through decentralized technologies and mechanisms,
allows us to cooperate and create in a trustless environment. This transformation is key to allowing global creativity and potential to be fully tapped and released.

Web3 is not only a technological innovation but also a great social practice, enabling everyone to actively participate in building a better world.
In this new era, we have the opportunity to support those innovative and potential developers and projects by choosing low-trust requirement crowdfunding tools.
In this way, while promoting the enhancement of our own value, we also promote the progress and development of society.

Thanks to this combination of thought and technology, giving us the opportunity to jointly build a fairer, more transparent, and sustainable future.
