### Reward Market: From "Waiting for the Truth" to "Seeking the Truth"

If WikiTruth's standard trading market is to let the truth "wait for the highest bidder", then the reward market is to let the demander "take the initiative".

The reward market allows any user (whether law enforcement agencies, corporate compliance departments, or victimized individuals) to publish reward tasks on-chain and lock the bounty in advance to collect specific evidence clues from the whole network. This completely changes the passive situation of traditional evidence collection.

### Pain Points and Solutions

In traditional judicial practice or commercial investigations, reward mechanisms face huge efficiency and trust black holes:

-   **Trust Crisis (for Informants)**: "What if you don't pay after I provide the clue?"
-   **Personal Safety (for Informants)**: "Will I be discovered by gangs if I meet with the police?"
-   **Invalid Information (for Publishers)**: Statistics show that in the hundreds of millions of dollars of rewards by judicial departments every year, a large amount of resources are wasted on screening false clues and dealing with professional fraudsters.
-   **Fund Opacity (for Public)**: Has the bounty really been issued? Is there internal corruption?

**WikiTruth Reward Market builds a perfect "contactless" decentralized solution through smart contracts and privacy computing:**

#### 1. On-chain Fund Escrow (Proof of Funds)
The publisher must deposit the full bounty (Stablecoin or WTRC) into the smart contract. This solves the informant's trust concern—**the money is there, the code manages it, and no one can default.**

#### 2. Contactless Delivery (Non-contact Delivery)
Informants do not need to meet with the police in "dark alleys". All evidence is uploaded encrypted through the WikiTruth platform. Based on the privacy features of Oasis Sapphire, the clue content is only visible to the reward publisher (private key holder), and others cannot pry.
> **Security Dividend**: Physical isolation fundamentally eliminates the risk of informant identity leakage and violent retaliation.

#### 3. Verify to Release
After the publisher decrypts and verifies the authenticity of the evidence, they call the contract to release the bounty.
*   **Dispute Resolution**: If the publisher obtains real evidence but maliciously refuses to pay, the informant can initiate arbitration and temporarily grant access to the encrypted evidence to the DAO arbitration tribunal (or multi-signature committee). Once the evidence is determined to be valid, the contract will forcibly transfer the bounty.

### Operating Mechanism

> Detailed operating mechanisms will be launched later; the following is just a draft!

1.  **Publish Bounty**:
    The publisher (Requester) sets the reward title, description, specific requirements for the required evidence, and stakes the full bounty to the contract.
2.  **Submit Evidence**:
    The insider (Hunter) sees the reward and uploads the evidence file. The system uses the publisher's public key to encrypt the evidence and generate an exclusive Evidence Box.
3.  **Verification**:
    The publisher views the evidence.
    -   **Pass**: The publisher confirms, the bounty is automatically transferred to the Hunter wallet, and the evidence is fully archived.
    -   **Reject**: The publisher considers the evidence invalid and returns the submission. If the Hunter is dissatisfied, they can apply for DAO intervention.

### Core Application Scenarios

-   **Law Enforcement and Judicial Assistance**:
    The police can set up an "anonymous reporting box" to replace the traditional informant fee payment process with smart contracts, improving the transparency of fund use and the efficiency of clue collection.
-   **Commercial Anti-Corruption and Compliance**:
    Corporate boards can publish rewards against internal corruption, encouraging knowledgeable employees to provide audit evidence while protecting their own safety.
-   **Civil Rewards and Missing Persons**:
    For missing persons cases and unsolved cases, victims' families can publish rewards to the whole network to gather scattered social forces.

### Summary

WikiTruth Reward Market builds a **Trustless Bridge** between police and informants through **"Funds Upfront"** and **"Privacy Delivery"**. We not only protect the evidence itself but are also committed to protecting everyone who dares to transmit the truth.
