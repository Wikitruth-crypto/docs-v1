### Governance Model

<!-- TODO: Add DAO governance flowchart -->

WikiTruth adopts a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, where the ultimate control of the protocol belongs to community members who stake WTRC. Through a transparent voting mechanism, the community can decide the platform's development direction, parameter adjustments, and major upgrades.

1.  **Governance Scope**: The DAO has the right to modify key protocol parameters (such as transaction fee rates, confidentiality fee coefficients, contract upgrades, etc.) through voting.
2.  **Voting Mechanism**: A weighted voting model is adopted, where voting weight is related to the amount of WTRC staked by the user and the duration of the stake (veToken concept), encouraging long-term holding and deep participation.

### Arbitration and Blacklist Rules

-   **Blacklist Governance**: The DAO can ban, refund, or destroy non-compliant addresses/Truth Boxes, with all operations recorded on-chain.
-   **Dispute Adjudication**: In scenarios such as refunds/arbitration, the DAO has the final power of adjudication and can authorize a multi-signature security council to handle high-risk events in emergencies.
-   **Openness and Transparency**: All proposals, votes, handling resolutions, and multi-signature operations should be publicly accessible.

### DAO Funds

-   **Witness Protection Fund**: Provides legal aid and financial support to participants who upload criminal evidence on the Truth Market and are willing to turn state's witness, helping them avoid threats of legal risks and encouraging more people to participate in reporting and disclosing criminal activities.

-   **Legal Advisory Fund**: Hires professional legal advisors in key rule-of-law countries to provide compliance advice, respond to legal challenges in different countries and regions, ensure the legitimacy and continuous operation of the project, and ensure the smooth operation of the Truth Market under various legal frameworks.

-   **Ecosystem Development Fund**: Used to promote the marketing and expansion of the Truth Market. By organizing online and offline activities (seminars, lectures, exhibitions, community gatherings, etc.), it enhances the project's influence, strengthens user loyalty, and attracts more participants.
