### Innovation: Redefining the Anchor of "Value"

WikiTruth is not another DeFi protocol, nor is it an ordinary NFT marketplace. We are pioneering a brand new paradigm: **Assetizing "social truth" and pricing "silence".**

#### 1. Innovation at the Asset Level: Truth as an Asset

In traditional Web3, assets are usually tokens or artworks. WikiTruth defines **"criminal evidence"** and **"social truth"** as a highly liquid crypto asset (Truth Box) for the first time.

-   **From "Virtual" to "Real"**: Behind every Truth Box corresponds to key information in the real world that may change the situation. Its value does not come from emotions, but from the rigid demand for truth in the real world.
-   **Ownership Confirmation**: Using NFT technology, we allow whistleblowers to truly own the ownership and disposal rights of the evidence, rather than just being a "Deep Throat" who may be silenced at any time.

#### 2. Innovation in Economic Model: Incremental Confidentiality Fee

This is WikiTruth's most disruptive design. We did not simply sell evidence, but designed a **"time game"**.

-   **Taxing Evil**: Want to cover up the truth? Sure, please pay. We allow buyers (usually interested parties) to purchase "silence" by paying confidentiality fees.
-   **Unsustainable Lies**: The confidentiality fee increases **exponentially** period by period. This means that the cost of covering up the truth will eventually exceed the buyer's ability to pay.
-   **Inevitable Disclosure**: This mechanism is mathematically destined: **All truth will eventually see the light of day, it's just a matter of time.** In this process, all funds flow to the providers of justice.

#### 3. Innovation in Technical Integration: Privacy Computing + Blockchain

We solved the natural contradiction between blockchain's "open transparency" and evidence's "need for confidentiality".

-   **Oasis Sapphire TEE**: Utilizing a Trusted Execution Environment to achieve "on-chain data invisibility, but logic execution". The contract can verify whether the buyer has paid, but the buyer can only see the decryption key after paying.
-   **Balance between Decentralization and Privacy**: We do not need a centralized server to keep evidence (preventing it from being bombed or seized), nor do we need to fully disclose evidence (preventing whistleblowers from losing leverage as soon as they publish).

### New Possibilities Brought

The emergence of WikiTruth opens the door to **"Justice-as-a-Service" (JaaS)**.

#### 1. Economic Liberation of Whistleblowers
In the past, whistleblowers often faced the risk of ruining their reputation and losing their jobs. WikiTruth provides them with a path to **"anonymous monetization"**. When justice is not just a moral impulse but a considerable income, we believe there will be a massive influx of truth into the market.

#### 2. Change in Judicial Game
For law enforcement agencies, key evidence can be obtained at extremely low cost by paying attention to WikiTruth's "Reward Market" or "Trading Market". For criminals, WikiTruth will become the Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads—**you never know when your accomplice will turn you into a Truth Box for WTRC.**

#### 3. The Ultimate Form of Prediction Markets
Traditional prediction markets (like Polymarket) bet on results, while WikiTruth trades the **insider information that determines the results**. This is a dimensional upgrade of the information disclosure mechanism.

WikiTruth is proving: **Web3 can not only be used to hype air, but also to purify the air.**
