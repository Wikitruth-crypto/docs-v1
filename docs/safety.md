### Risk and Compliance

-   **Legal Advisory and Monitoring**: Establish a legal advisory fund, cooperate with multiple legal teams, and continuously monitor regulatory changes in major jurisdictions; the DAO regularly assesses legal risks and formulates response strategies, adjusting parameters or temporarily freezing high-risk assets when necessary.
-   **Periodic Compliance Checks**: Release a "Compliance Memorandum" quarterly, marking potential regulatory changes and impact assessments.
-   **Respect for Data Sovereignty**: Provide configurable regional isolation strategies for sensitive regions (in planning).
-   **Law Enforcement Cooperation Boundaries**: The DAO votes on whether to pay a portion of the reward to the Minter on behalf of specific cases in exchange for the rapid disclosure of the truth.
