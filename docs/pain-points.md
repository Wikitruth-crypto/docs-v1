### Social Status Quo

> How do bad people succeed? First by not letting good people benefit, then good people lose their enthusiasm, and finally bad people succeed.

![Justice and Evil](/docs/good-bad.jpg)

The long history of mankind is also a history of long-term confrontation with crime and injustice. Although we have established complex judicial systems to try to punish evil and promote good, in reality, power, money, and interest networks corrode the foundation of this system like vines. Too much truth is obscured, evidence disappears, and justice is delayed. The more critical the evidence, the easier it is to become the object of sealing, tampering, and buying out. As a result, victims lose their voices, insiders remain silent, and the public is trapped in fear and powerlessness.

-   **Systemic Risk**: Centralized institutions (judiciary, media, etc.) are vulnerable to human intervention, leading to opaque evidence handling processes and potentially distorted results.
-   **Whistleblower Safety**: Lack of effective and technically guaranteed anonymous mechanisms exposes evidence providers to the risk of identity leakage and potential retaliation by criminal forces.
-   **Evidence Persistence and Integrity**: Physical or digital evidence in centralized storage systems runs the risk of being tampered with, destroyed, or lost due to server shutdowns.
-   **Low Collaboration Efficiency**: In transnational or cross-agency cases, data sharing and collaboration face legal and operational barriers, resulting in low efficiency.
-   **Lack of Public Enthusiasm**: Although there are many righteous people in society, they basically rely on personal conscience and moral drive, and most people are indifferent to such events.

Countless historical cases show that disclosure models relying solely on personal morality or institutional self-discipline are difficult to work in the long term. We need a mechanism that does not rely on human nature and power as prerequisites: let rules be executed, let data be immutable, let processes be verifiable, and let costs be quantified.

### How WikiTruth Reshapes the Landscape of Justice

Web3 technology, with its disruptive characteristics, provides new ideas for solving the above dilemmas:

-   **Privacy Blockchain**: Blockchain has an immutable public ledger recorded in chronological order. On-chain operations are permanently recorded and cannot be modified by a single party. Public code logic automatically executed on-chain removes centralized intermediaries, realizing "code is law". Oasis Sapphire provides a private blockchain environment ensuring the privacy and security of on-chain data.
-   **Decentralized Storage**: Protocols like IPFS/Arweave distribute data shards across global nodes, possessing high availability and censorship resistance. A single node or institution cannot delete data, ensuring the permanent existence of evidence and resistance to power interference.
-   **Token Economy**: The token economy transforms "telling the truth" into quantifiable economic returns, incentivizing more people to participate.
-   **Proxy Interaction**: Through EIP-712 signature authorization, users interact with contracts through official relay accounts without directly interacting with contracts, leaving no traces on the blockchain network.
-   **Privacy Token**: Through privacy tokens and EIP-712 signature interaction, on-chain fund flows cannot be traced.

Building a decentralized trading market that directly links "truth" with "economic value", so that exposing evil no longer comes at the cost of sacrificing personal safety, and truth is no longer subject to human intervention and tampering, but relies on publicly verifiable protocol rules where code is law and justice is rewarded.
