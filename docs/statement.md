### Important Statement

Before using the WikiTruth platform or reading this white paper and related documents, please carefully read and understand the following statements. This document is intended to provide information and does not constitute any form of offer, solicitation, or advice.

#### 1. Not Investment Advice

All information contained in this document (including but not limited to project vision, technical architecture, token economic model, roadmap, and market analysis) is for reference only and does not constitute any investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice. Crypto assets are highly volatile and carry significant market risks, which may result in the loss of your entire investment. Please consult an independent professional financial advisor and conduct sufficient due diligence before investing.

#### 2. Not Legal or Tax Advice

This document does not constitute legal, tax, or other professional advice. Laws and regulations in the blockchain and cryptocurrency fields are complex and changing, and vary by jurisdiction. You should seek professional advice from independent legal and tax advisors to understand the applicability, legality, and tax implications of the WikiTruth platform or WTRC tokens to your personal situation.

#### 3. Technical Risks

The WikiTruth platform is built on complex Web3 and privacy computing technologies, including smart contracts, decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave), Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), etc. Although the team will try its best to ensure code security, all software systems may have unknown vulnerabilities or errors. Technical risks include:

-   **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: May lead to fund loss or system failure.
-   **Cyber Attacks**: Including but not limited to DDoS attacks, supply chain attacks, or attacks against the underlying blockchain network.
-   **Failure of Privacy Computing Assumptions**: If basic assumptions of privacy technologies like TEE are breached, it may lead to confidential data leakage.
-   **Upgrade Risks**: Contract upgrades may introduce new errors or produce unforeseen impacts.

#### 4. Regulatory Risks

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology face an uncertain regulatory environment globally. New laws and regulations may emerge in the future, or the interpretation of existing regulations may change, which may have a significant adverse impact on the operation of the WikiTruth project, the value of WTRC tokens, or user participation. WikiTruth may not be able to operate legally in all jurisdictions, and users are responsible for complying with local laws and regulations.

#### 5. Market Risks

The price of WTRC tokens may be extremely volatile, affected by various factors such as market sentiment, liquidity, technical development, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory changes. The value of evidence and the level of confidentiality fees on the WikiTruth platform are also affected by market supply and demand dynamics and may not achieve the expected results.

#### 6. Accuracy of Information

The information in this document is based on currently available data and the team's best judgment. We strive for the accuracy and completeness of the information but are not responsible for any errors, omissions, or obsolescence. Future developments, events, or circumstances may differ from forward-looking statements in this document.

#### 7. User Responsibility
