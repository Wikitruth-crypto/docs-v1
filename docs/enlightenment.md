### Enlightenment: What Do We Believe In?

In this world of accelerating entropy and increasing chaos, we are encountering an unprecedented "trust crisis".

Why do Ponzi schemes always harvest wealth under gorgeous cloaks?
Why do sacred vows often turn to dust in the face of interests?
Why do centralized institutions with huge power often fail to resist internal corruption in the end?

If you look through the fog of phenomena and gaze at the underlying code of this society, you will find a disturbing truth: **Our civilization is built on extremely fragile and expensive "interpersonal trust".**

### 1. The Cost of Trust and the Dividend of Lies

Every interaction in the operation of human society—whether it is business transactions, judicial judgments, or information dissemination—is essentially "trust lending".

-   **Information Asymmetry**: We cannot confirm the other party's intentions, nor can we verify the authenticity of every piece of information omnisciently.
-   **Verification Lag**: Lies are sweet and immediate, while the verification of truth is always long and painful. Liars use this "time difference" to run halfway around the earth before the truth arrives.
-   **Human Nature Black Box**: We place our hopes on moral self-discipline and the conscience of regulators. But history has proven countless times that **human nature is an unreliable variable. Any system that relies on human nature will eventually be exploited by human nature.**

This is why liars succeed repeatedly: in systems with opaque information and opaque execution, **the cost of doing evil is far lower than the benefit of gaining trust.**

### 2. Code is Law: From "Don't Be Evil" to "Can't Be Evil"

The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology is not just an innovation of financial tools, but a **species evolution regarding "trust"**. It attempts to use mathematical certainty to fill the black hole of human nature's uncertainty.

When we write rules into smart contracts and store evidence in immutable blocks, we are experiencing a paradigm shift:

-   **Decentralization**: There is no longer a need for an omniscient "middleman" to maintain order. When power is dispersed across every node of the network, single-point corruption cannot shake the overall justice.
-   **Code Enforcement**: In the world of WikiTruth, if the confidentiality fee is not paid, the truth will be automatically disclosed. This does not require a judge's ruling, does not require the enforcement bureau to run around, and is not affected by bribery. This is **an inevitability like physical laws**, not an accident of human will.
-   **Permissionless Verification**: You don't need to "believe" me, you just need to verify the code. Trust changes from emotional "faith" to rational "calculation".

This does not mean a world that does not need morality, but rather unloads the burden of morality from the fragile shoulders of human nature, and through technical means, makes **"honesty" the optimal game strategy in the system.**

### 3. Questions for a Chaotic World

Standing at the crossroads of Web3, WikiTruth wants to ask the world a few questions:

> If the truth is no longer a little girl who can be dressed up by anyone, but a hard, indelible encrypted rock, how should those who are accustomed to operating power in the dark adapt to the light?

> If the truth is disclosed in a positive way without incurring huge judicial costs, how will our society be reconstructed?

> When the "cost of trust" brought by information asymmetry is infinitely approached to zero by technology, what amazing energy will human collaboration release?

We firmly believe that Web3 can change the world, not because it can create myths of sudden wealth, but because it provides a possibility—**to build a lighthouse based on mathematical truth on a wasteland full of lies.**

It lets us see that even in the most chaotic darkness, there is still a force that is **immutable, undeniable, and inevitably executed.**

This force is named **Consensus**.
