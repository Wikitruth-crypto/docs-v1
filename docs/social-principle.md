### Society and Human Nature: Why is Justice Silent?

![User Group](/docs/user-group.svg)

Human society's desire for justice is eternal, yet when individuals face powerful injustice or criminal forces, they often fall into collective silence. WikiTruth understands the complex human nature behind this.

1.  **Tear between Moral Conscience and Fear**: Insiders crave justice but are bound by fear—fear of retaliation, fear of loss, fear of the unknown. The conflict between morality and realistic interests is the first high wall preventing the truth from surfacing.
2.  **Lack of Anonymity and Security Guarantees**: Under a centralized power system, whistleblower identity information is easily leaked, leading to retaliation. A truly safe, anonymous, and technically untraceable channel is a necessary prerequisite for releasing conscience.
3.  **Incentives for Benefits and Action**: Justice actions driven purely by morality are difficult to sustain. When providing the truth can yield reasonable returns, justice behavior will transform from individual sacrifice into sustainable social momentum.
4.  **Irreversible Energy of Truth**: Truth is the terminator of all lies. Once key criminal facts are disclosed, no matter how powerful the influence, its foundation will be shaken.
5.  **Bridging the Gap between Justice and Reality**: Most people yearn for justice but are often suppressed by reality. WikiTruth provides a safe channel and financial support for those who are willing but unable to release their courage.

### Criminal Mentality: Spiral of Fear and Cost

WikiTruth deeply perceives the psychological weaknesses of criminals and transforms their fear into bargaining chips for maintaining justice.

1.  **Absolute Fear of Exposure**: What criminals fear most is not the law itself, but the complete exposure of the truth—meaning the collapse of social status, wealth, and reputation, and the ensuing legal sanctions and public opinion trials.
2.  **Drive of Concealment Costs**: To maintain the "illusion", criminals may be willing to pay a high price to cover up the truth. WikiTruth's "Incremental Confidentiality Fee" mechanism accurately captures this psychology, making covering up the truth an unsustainable economic black hole.
3.  **Shattering of Fluke Mentality**: Criminals always think the truth can be buried forever. But the inevitable disclosure of the WikiTruth mechanism will completely shatter this fluke.
4.  **Disintegration of Internal Trust**: Criminal gangs are full of distrust. WikiTruth becomes a sword hanging over all accomplices—you never know who will turn you into a Truth Box for huge returns, thereby triggering internal games.
5.  **Deterrence of Unknown Authenticity**: Even if unsure of the authenticity of the evidence in the Truth Box, the uncertainty of "what if it's true?" is enough to make criminals restless, prompting them to pay the price to verify authenticity.

WikiTruth precisely anchors and amplifies these complex human nature and social games, using the power of code to leverage the balance of justice.
