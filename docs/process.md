### Operational Process

![Simple Process](/docs/symbol-process.svg)

Suppose a (Criminal) has committed some illegal acts, and the evidence is held by a (Minter) and sold on WikiTruth, while the demander (Buyer) needs to buy it to avoid risks or try to delay the disclosure of the truth. The process is as follows:

-   **Mint Truth Box**: Upload encrypted files and metadata to IPFS/Arweave, and mint a Truth Box in the contract.
-   **Trading**: The Truth Box can be listed for sale or auction. Helpers (Seller\Completer) may participate in proxy selling/completing transactions, and DAO governance will participate in audits when trading disputes occur.
-   **Confidentiality Period**: After the transaction is completed, it enters the confidentiality period. The Buyer needs to pay the confidentiality fee on time to extend the confidentiality period, otherwise the Truth Box will be automatically disclosed.
-   **Disclosure**: Automatically disclosed when the confidentiality period expires or no one buys it, letting the truth return to the public eye.

WikiTruth's value comes from the high cost of "covering up the truth": the concealer has to pay fees and confidentiality costs before the truth is forced to go public; while participants who provide evidence and maintain order receive returns, forming a long-term sustainable positive incentive.
