### Project Overview

> If you have never been exposed to Web3 and need to upload evidence to WikiTruth, we suggest you read this document first to understand the technical knowledge and operational process of WikiTruth.

WikiTruth is built on **Oasis Sapphire** (EVM-compatible privacy public chain) and **IPFS** (decentralized storage), aiming to solve the problems of privacy storage, trusted trading, and secure disclosure of "criminal evidence" in the real world.

WikiTruth integrates encrypted storage, token incentives, and good-vs-evil game mechanisms through blockchain encryption technology to build a complete market around "trusted trading of criminal evidence". It solves the objective high-risk problem in the real world where "telling the truth exposes personal information and is disadvantageous to oneself". It guarantees the privacy of identity information, the content of evidence, and the persistence and integrity of evidence, ensuring that it can be protected, verified, and ultimately disclosed.

The core mission of WikiTruth is to establish a "safe channel to tell the truth" using decentralization and privacy computing. We believe that when exposing the truth no longer means being isolated and helpless, but instead receiving protection and rewards, and making those who try to cover up the truth pay a higher cost, it will promote social transparency and justice.

We are pioneering a brand new "Crime Evidence Economy", deeply integrating Web3 encryption technology with the most urgent real-world problems to build a decentralized, private, anonymous, unmanipulatable, non-deceptive, fair, secure, and rewarding criminal evidence market.

### Core Features

- **Decentralization**: Core business logic is executed by on-chain smart contracts, not controlled by any single entity, eliminating power monopolies and single-point manipulation.
- **Anonymity**: Interaction only requires mapping between wallet addresses and user IDs, collecting no personal identity information, maximizing the protection of whistleblowers and evidence uploaders.
- **Security**: Evidence is encrypted locally, and decryption keys are encrypted on-chain via Sapphire TEE. Smart contracts constrain that only holders can read private data, ensuring content and key security.
- **Economic Incentives**: Criminals who want to hide the truth must buy and pay confidentiality fees, while positive behaviors (such as providing evidence) receive corresponding income. A virtuous cycle of supply and demand drives the market.
- **Community Governance**: DAO governance, collective decision-making, fully transparent on-chain.
- **Incremental Confidentiality Fee Mechanism**: By increasing the confidentiality fee period by period, the cost of covering up evidence for a long time is raised, forcing criminals to actively show up or give up covering up the truth; the subsequent chapter "Rewards and Confidentiality Fees" will explain in detail.

> The biggest feature of WikiTruth is that supply creates demand: provide the truth first, then demand (disclose/cover up) the truth.
