### Native Token WTRC

Truth Coin (WTRC) is the native token of the WikiTruth ecosystem, used for in-platform transactions, governance, and incentives. The total supply is fixed, and the token is the core infrastructure supporting the sustainable development of the ecosystem.

### Token Allocation Plan

> We have not yet launched a specific token allocation plan, but we will launch a reasonable token allocation plan based on the development of the project.
