### Future Outlook

WikiTruth's vision is to create a Web3 on-chain crime and truth revelation platform based on privacy encryption technology: technology is responsible for "verifiability", the economic model is responsible for "sustainability", and the community is responsible for "governability", making the defense of justice no longer a lonely battle for a few.

#### Technical Development Direction

-   **AI Integration**: Explore using AI for non-intrusive feature analysis and classification of encrypted evidence to improve market efficiency and authenticity.
-   **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Implement cross-chain deployment through protocols like LayerZero to allow users from more public chains to participate.
-   **Privacy Computing**: Introduce MPC / FHE technologies to achieve more complex and protected data collaboration.

#### Frontier Technology Exploration

-   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Research proving evidence formats/keywords without revealing content to improve credibility.
-   **Private Transactions**: Further combine ZKP/MPC/FHE on the basis of Sapphire to achieve finer-grained permission control and verifiable privacy custody.

#### Ecosystem Vision

The future WikiTruth will cover full-link services of evidence collection, verification, trading, disclosure, and legal aid, and cooperate with global legal institutions, media organizations, and public welfare groups to improve the accessibility and enforceability of truth.

#### Milestones and Delivery Plan

1.  **Short Term (Testnet Phase)**: Complete privacy token EIP-712 testing, parameter tuning, public security testing, and Bug Bounty.
2.  **Medium Term (Mainnet Early Phase)**: Release mainnet contracts and address list, launch DAO parameter governance and emergency fund, release multi-language documentation and SDK.
3.  **Long Term**: Cross-chain deployment, more privacy computing integration, standardized cooperation agreements with judicial/media/public welfare organizations, forming a verifiable global truth network.

#### Establishing a Justice Alliance

Transnational Cooperation and Support: Unite with international non-governmental organizations and rule-of-law organizations to launch cooperation and form a global alliance for justice to provide international support for the exposure of systemic corruption and evil forces.
Resource and Knowledge Sharing: Provide a platform allowing users from different countries to share their experiences and needed resources to combat evil forces more effectively.
WikiTruth will be committed to exposing the actions of evil forces to the sunlight by discovering and spreading the truth, thereby enhancing society's resilience against them. Although challenges remain, the power of justice should never be underestimated and will eventually guide people in the darkness.
